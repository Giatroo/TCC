Sarcasm detection is an important aspect of many natural language processing
(NLP) systems, with many implications in natural language understanding, dialog
systems and data mining. However, sarcasm detection is difficult because it's
infrequent in many conversations and, many times, it's difficult even for humans
to discern.

Many studies have been made in the area and many datasets have been proposed
with either \textit{balanced} or \textit{unbalanced} data. Also many of these
datasets use humans to annotate sarcastic statements.

In this paper, we use the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), which is a large
corpus for sarcasm detection created using Reddit posts to get labels
automatically, to train, evaluate, and compare many NLP models.
